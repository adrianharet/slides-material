    % A group \(N = \{1, \dots, n\}\) of \(n\) \emph{players}. 
    % Each player \(i\) makes a \emph{contribution} \(c_i \in \{0, 1\}\).
    % Contributions generate a \emph{benefit} \(b(\bm{c})\), with \(\bm{c} = (c_1, \dots, c_n)\).\\

    % Player \(i\)'s \emph{utility} is:
    % \[
    %     u_i(\bm{c}) = b (\bm{c}) - c_i.
    % \]
    % % The \emph{social welfare} of the group is:
    % % \[
    % %     \mathit{sw}(\bm{c}) = \sum_{i} u_i(\bm{c}).
    % % \]

    % The public good, valued at \(r > 1\), is provided just in case the fraction of contributors is at least 
    % a certain \emph{threshold} \({\theta \in [0, 1]}\):
    % \[
    %     b (\bm{c}) =
    %     \begin{cases}
    %         r  & \text{if the fraction of contributors in } \bm{c} \text{ is} \geq \theta,\\ 
    %         0, & \text{otherwise}.
    %     \end{cases}  
    % \]


    % Take \(\theta = \nicefrac{1}{2}\)\\
    
    % At least three contributors are needed for the public good to be provided.\\

    % A player has an incentive to contribute only if they are \emph{pivotal}.


    

    % In experimental settings, the benefit function is often:
    % \[
    %     b(\bm{c}) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{i}c_i \cdot g,
    % \]
    % for some \(g > 1\).\\

    % In this setting, contributing \(0\) is a dominant strategy.\\ 

    % But we get the same equilibria (with \(0\) and \(k\) contributors) 
    % if the game is repeated for \(m > \nicefrac{(n-1)}{n} \cdot \nicefrac{r}{(r-1)}\) rounds
    % and players play a threshold \emph{strategy}. 

    

    % For a threshold of \(k\),\(^*\) profiles with exactly \(k\) contributors are equilibria.\\
    
    % The profile with \(0\) contributors is also an equilibrium (except when \(k=1\)).

    % \begin{flushright}
    %     \(^*\)Every threshold \(\theta\) corresponds to an integer threshold of \(k \in \{0,\dots, n\}\).
    % \end{flushright}


    % Take the threshold to be \(\theta = \nicefrac{1}{2}\), i.e., 
    % a player benefits only if at least half of their closed neighborhood contribute.\\ 
    
    % A profile where everyone contributes is still not an equilibrium.\\

    % The profile with \(0\) contributors is no longer an equilibrium (!).\\
    
    % The profile where only the center contributes is not an equilibrium.\\

    % But the profile where only the agents on the periphery contribute is an equilibrium.


    % On average, we get around \(qn\) initial contributors.


    % Assume the game is played over several rounds.\\

    % At every new round, player \(i\) contributes their \emph{best response} 
    % \(\mathit{br}_i(\bm{c})\) with respect to the previous contributions \(\bm{c}\):
    % \[
    %     \mathit{br}_i(\bm{c}) = 
    %     \begin{cases}
    %         1, &\text{if } i \text{ is pivotal in } \bm{c},\\
    %         0, &\text{otherwise}.            
    %     \end{cases}
    % \]



    % If exactly three (or two!) players contribute initially, 
    % we reach an equilibrium with three contributors.\\

    % Anything else and we end up in the \((0, \dots, 0)\) equilibrium.


    % At every new round \(t+1\), player \(i\) contributes:
    % \[
    %     c_i ^{t+1} = 
    %     \begin{cases}
    %         \mathit{br}_i(\bm{c}^t), &\text{with probability } 1-\alpha, \\ 
    %         c_i^t, &\text{with probability } \alpha.
    %     \end{cases}
    % \]


    % With \(\alpha = 1\), players just repeat their initial contribution.\\

    % With \(\alpha = 0\), players invariably play their best response.\\

    % For \(0 < \alpha < 1\), players play a mixture.\\

    % The equilibrium at \(\theta\) is reached, most of the time, if 
    % \(q > \theta\).\\ 
    
    % But only for very high \(\alpha\)!


    % A \emph{social norm applied to player \(i\)} is a function 
    % \(\nu \colon N \times \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}\):
    % \[
    %     (i, \bm{c}) \longmapsto  \nu_i (\bm{c})
    % \]




    % Take \(\alpha \in [0, 1]\), the \emph{prosociality} of players.\\

    % At every new round \(t+1\), player \(i\) contributes:
    % \[
    %     c_i ^{t+1} = 
    %     \begin{cases}
    %         \nu_i(\bm{c}^t), &\text{with probability } \alpha,\\
    %         \mathit{br}_i(\bm{c}^t), &\text{with probability } 1-\alpha.
    %     \end{cases}
    % \]



    % \begin{tabular}{rl}
    %     Best Response: & \(\nu_i(\bm{c}) = \mathit{br}_i(\bm{c})\) \\[0.2cm]
    %     Be Yourself: & \(\nu_i(\bm{c}) = c_i\)  \\[0.2cm] 
    %     Be Like Others: & 
    %     \(\nu_i(\bm{c}) = \text{the majority contribution in } \bm{c}_{-i}\) \\ 
    %     \dots   & \dots
    % \end{tabular}


    % The majority rule ('Be Like Others') does a bit better, at lower values of 
    % prosociality.\\ 

    % But we still need \(q > \theta\)!

    % So far we have been assuming that everyone is connected to everyone else.\\ 

    % But many other structures are possible.



    % On networks, \(i\)'s utility is:
    % \[
    %     u_i(\bm{c}) = b{\left( \bm{c}_{N[i]} \right)} - c_i,
    % \]
    % where \(N[i]\) contains \(i\)'s neighbors, plus \(i\).\\


    % Player \(i\) wants to contribute only if they are pivotal
    % \emph{in their neighborhood} \(N[i]\).



    % Take \(\theta = \nicefrac{1}{2}\) and a star graph.\\ 

    % Everyone contributing still not an equilibrium.\\ 

    % No contributors is not an equilibrium (!).\\ 

    % Only the players on the periphery contributing is an equilibrium.


    % Consider the \emph{Be Like Others} norm, with \(\alpha=1\).\(^*\)\\ 

    % If the two players in the center start out cooperating,
    % we eventually get full cooperation!\\ 

    % And this generalizes to larger graphs.

    % \begin{flushright}
    %     \(^*\)Assume tie-breaking favors contributing.
    % \end{flushright}

    % The more structured the graph, the better.

    % Scale-free networks, generated using a preferential attachment mechanism.

    % Social norms as internalized behavior rules (requirements).\\ 

    % Powerful, and even more so in the presence of social networks.








    % There is a set \(N = \{1, \dots, n\}\) of \emph{players}.
    
    % \vspace{1em}
    % Each player \(i\) starts with an \emph{endowment} \(e\)
    % and makes a \emph{contribution} \(c_i \in [0, e]\).

    % \vspace{1em}
    % The \emph{public good} is obtained by pooling all contributions,
    % and multiplying them by a constant \(r > 1\).

    % \vspace{1em}    
    % Each player receives an equal share of the public good.


    % If player \(i\) contributes \(c_i > 0\), they make:
    % \begin{flalign*}
    %     \qquad
    %     e - c_i + r \cdot \frac{\sum_{j \neq i}c_j + c_i}{n}. &&
    % \end{flalign*}
    % If player \(i\) lowers their contribution to \(c'_i < c_i\), while 
    % everyone else keeps their contribution constant, they make:
    % \begin{flalign*}
    %     \qquad
    %     e - c'_i + r \cdot \frac{\sum_{j \neq i}c_j + c'_i}{n}. &&
    % \end{flalign*}
    % Lowering the contribution is worth it just in case:
    % \begin{flalign*}
    %     \qquad
    %     e - c'_i + r \cdot \frac{\sum_{j \neq i}c_j + c'_i}{n} &> e - c_i + r \cdot \frac{\sum_{j \neq i}c_j + c_i}{n} & \text{iff} \\
    %     c_i - c'_i & > r \cdot \frac{c_i-c'_i}{n} &\text{iff} \\
    %     n & > r.&
    % \end{flalign*}




    % If everyone contributes \(0\), there is no public good and each player 
    % is stuck with their initial endowment \(e\).\\

    % \vspace{1em}
    % In this situation, if a player \(i\) decides to deviate and contribute \(c_i > 0\), they make:
    % \begin{flalign*}
    %     \qquad
    %     e - c_i + r \cdot \frac{c_i}{n} & < e, & \text{as long as } r < n. &&
    % \end{flalign*}






    There is a set \(N = \{1, \dots, n\}\) of \emph{players}.
    
    \vspace{1em}
    At the first round players either 
    make a \emph{contribution} of \(c > 0\), or \emph{freeride} by contributing \(0\).

    \vspace{1em}
    If there are enough\(^*\) contributions 
    the public good is provided and everyone receives a benefit \(b > c\).

    \vspace{1em}
    At the second round an authority imposes a penalty \(h\) to 
    non-contributors.
