    % \emph{Nature} determines the state:
    % \emph{High} with probability \(p\) and \emph{Low} with probability \(1 - p\).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\) can get evidence of the state:
    % with probability \(q_h\) if state is High,
    % and \(q_\ell\) if state is Low.
    % In the remaining cases Player \(1\) gets no evidence.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\) sees only the evidence, if any, 
    % but not the state itself (dashed line).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % If in possession of evidence, Player \(1\) chooses whether to reveal it (R or \(\lnot\)R)
    % to Player \(2\). If Player \(1\) hasn't gotten any evidence,
    % they don't reveal anything (\(\lnot\)R).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(2\) observes only Player \(1\)'s action (\(\textsf{X} \in \{\textsf{R}, \lnot \textsf{R}\}\)),
    % but not the state or the evidence (dashed lines).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Based on Player \(1\)'s action, Player \(2\) updates 
    % their posterior belief about the state:
    % \[
    %     {\Pr}\Big[ \text{High} \mid \textsf{X} \Big].
    % \]
    % Player \(1\)'s utility is Player \(2\)'s posterior about the state being High.\(^*\)



    % Consider the strategy profile in which:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Player \(1\) reveals the evidence when getting it, and (obviously) withholds it otherwise;
    %     \item Player \(2\) updates their posterior---expecting that Player \(1\) reveals the evidence when they have it, and does not reveal it otherwise.
    % \end{itemize}
    % Player \(2\)'s posteriors, given they expect Player \(1\) to follow this strategy, are:
    % \begin{flalign*}
    %     \qquad
    %     {\Pr}\Big[ \text{High} \mid \textsf{R} \Big] &=
    %     \frac{{\Pr}\big[ \textsf{R} \mid \textsf{High} \big] \cdot {\Pr}\big[ \textsf{High}\big]}{{\Pr}\big[ \textsf{R}\big]} 
    %     = \frac{q_h \cdot p}{q_h \cdot p + (1 - q_h) (1 - p)}, &\\
    %     {\Pr}\Big[ \text{High} \mid \lnot \textsf{R} \Big] 
    %     & =\frac{{\Pr}\big[ \lnot\textsf{R} \mid \textsf{High} \big] \cdot {\Pr}\big[ \textsf{High}\big]}{{\Pr}\big[ \lnot\textsf{R}\big]}
    %     =\frac{(1 - q_h) p}{(1 - q_h) p + (1-q_\ell) (1 - p)}.&
    % \end{flalign*}
    % This is an equilibrium as long as Player \(1\) does not want to deviate,
    % which happens as long as \({\Pr}\big[ \text{High} \mid \textsf{R} \big] \geq {\Pr}\big[ \text{High} \mid \lnot \textsf{R} \big]\). 
    
    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Equivalent to:
    % \begin{flalign*}
    %     \qquad
    %     \frac{q_h \cdot p}{q_h \cdot p + (1 - q_h) (1 - p)} \geq \frac{(1 - q_h) p}{(1 - q_h) p + (1-q_\ell) (1 - p)} & \text{ iff } q_h \geq q_\ell.&
    % \end{flalign*}





    % Consider the alternative strategy profile in which:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Player \(1\) never reveals anything, even when they have evidence;
    %     \item Player \(2\) updates their posterior---expecting that Player \(1\) never reveals.
    % \end{itemize}
    % Player \(2\)'s posteriors, given they expect Player \(1\) to follow this strategy, are:
    % \begin{flalign*}
    %     \qquad
    %     {\Pr}\Big[ \text{High} \mid \textsf{R} \Big] &=
    %     \frac{{\Pr}\big[ \textsf{R} \mid \textsf{High} \big] \cdot {\Pr}\big[ \textsf{High}\big]}{{\Pr}\big[ \textsf{R}\big]} 
    %     = \frac{0 \cdot p}{0 \cdot p + (1 - q_h) (1 - p)} = 0, &\\
    %     {\Pr}\Big[ \text{High} \mid \lnot \textsf{R} \Big] 
    %     & =\frac{{\Pr}\big[ \lnot\textsf{R} \mid \textsf{High} \big] \cdot {\Pr}\big[ \textsf{High}\big]}{{\Pr}\big[ \lnot\textsf{R}\big]}
    %     =\frac{1 \cdot p}{1} = p.&
    % \end{flalign*}
    % Player \(1\) does not want to switch to revealing, so this is also an equilibrium.




    % Nature determines the state (High or Low) with probability \(p\)
    % and generates evidence with probabilities \(q_h\) and \(q_\ell\), respectively.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\) does not have immediate access to the evidence, but has to search for it.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\) can search for evidence, 
    % using two levels of effort: Max, which involves cost \(c\),
    % and Min, which involves cost \(0\).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % If it exists, evidence is obtained (O) with probabilities \(f_{max}\) or \(f_{min}\), 
    % depending on the effort expended (\(f_{max} > f_{min}\)). In the remaining cases,
    % no evidence is obtained (\(\lnot\)O).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\) chooses whether to reveal evidence (R or \(\lnot\)R), if obtained.
    % If no evidence is obtained, Player \(1\) does not reveal anything (\(\lnot\)R).


    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(2\) updates their posterior belief about the state depending on whether 
    % Player \(1\) reveals evidence or not.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\)'s utility is Player \(2\)'s posterior about the state, together with the search cost.





    % Consider the strategy profile in which:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Player \(1\) expends Max effort and reveals the evidence when getting it;
    %     \item Player \(2\) updates their posterior as usual.
    % \end{itemize}
    

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % This is an equilibrium as long as:
    % \begin{flalign*}
    %     \quad
    %     c  \leq \big(f_{max} - f_{min}\big) \cdot {\Pr}\big[ \textsf{Ev} \big]
    %     \cdot \bigg({\Pr}\big[ \text{High} \mid \textsf{R} \big] - {\Pr}\big[ \text{High} \mid \lnot\textsf{R} \big]\bigg).&&
    % \end{flalign*}





    % Nature determines the state (High or Low) with probability \(p\).
    % Player \(1\) does not know the state.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\) can choose a test \((q_h, q_\ell)\), with \(q_h > q_\ell\).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Evidence is generated according to the chosen test, and the state of the world.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % If evidence is generated, Player \(1\) automatically observes it and chooses whether to 
    % reveal it to Player~\(2\).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(2\) updates their posterior belief about the state depending on whether 
    % Player \(1\) reveals evidence or not, and their beliefs about the test and state.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\)'s utility is Player \(2\)'s posterior about the state.




    Consider the strategy profile in which:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Player \(1\) chooses a test that maximizes \(q_h\) and \(q_\ell\), 
                and reveals evidence when generated.
        \item Player \(2\) updates as usual.
    \end{itemize}
    

    \vspace{0.2cm}
    This is an equilibrium.
