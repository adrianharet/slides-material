\begin{document}\raggedright
% We represent a \emph{social network} as a graph $G = (V, E)$, 
% where $V$ is the set of \emph{vertices} (agents) and 
% $E$ is the set of \emph{edges} (relationships).
% \vspace{1em}

% The graph can be \emph{directed} or \emph{undirected}, 
% depending on whether relationships are one-way or two-way.


% The \emph{degree} \(d_i\) of a node \(i\) is the number of edges connected to it:
% \begin{align*}
%     d_i & = \big|\big\{j \in V \mid (i, j) \in E\big\}\big|.&
% \end{align*}





% The \emph{degree distribution} \(P(d)\) of a network is a description of the relative frequencies of nodes that
% have different degrees. 
% \vspace{1em}

% In other words, \(P(d)\) is the fraction of nodes that have degree \(d\).
% \vspace{1em}

% The function \(P\) can be a frequency distribution, if we are describing a specific network;
% or a probability distribution, if we are working with random networks.



% For a set of \(n\) nodes and a probability \(p\), the \emph{Erdős-Rényi model} generates a random graph \(G(n, p)\) 
% by going through all possible pairs of nodes and adding an edge between them with probability \(p\).




% The degree distribution of an Erdős-Rényi random graph \(G(n, p)\) is given by the \emph{binomial distribution}:
% \[
%     {\Pr}\Big[ d = k \Big] = {n-1 \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-1-k}.
% \]

% The `typical' node has degree \((n-1)p\).



% A \emph{scale-free network} is a type of network whose degree distribution follows a power law:
% \[
%     P(d) \sim c \cdot d^{-\gamma},
% \]
% where \(c>0\) and \(\gamma\) is a constant typically in the range \(2 < \gamma < 3\).

% The relative frequencies stay constant as the degree grows from \(d\) to \(kd\):
% \vspace{1em}

% Thus:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     \frac{P(kd)}{P(d)} & = \frac{c \cdot k^{-\gamma} d ^{-\gamma}}{c \cdot d^{-\gamma}} &\\ 
%                        & = k^{-\gamma}. &
% \end{flalign*}
% This is true regardless of the degree \(d\) we start with:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     \frac{P(2)}{P(1)} & = \frac{P(20)}{P(10)} = \frac{P(200)}{P(100)} = \dots&
% \end{flalign*}
% This is best seen when graphing the degree distribution.
% \vspace{1em}

% On a log-log scale, the degree distribution of a scale-free network appears as a straight line with slope \(-\gamma\).

% The \emph{distance} \(d(i, j)\) between two nodes \(i\) and \(j\) 
% in a network is the length of the shortest path between \(i\) and \(j\).

% The \emph{diameter} of a network \(G\) is the maximum distance between any two nodes:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     \text{diam}(G) & = \max_{i, j \in V} d(i, j). &
% \end{flalign*}


The maximum distance (i.e., diameter) is 
\(2\) in \(G_1\). 
\vspace{1em}

And \(4\) in \(G_2\).
