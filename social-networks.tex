% We represent a \emph{social network} as a graph $G = (V, E)$, 
% where $V$ is the set of \emph{vertices} (agents) and 
% $E$ is the set of \emph{edges} (relationships).
% \vspace{1em}

% The graph can be \emph{directed} or \emph{undirected}, 
% depending on whether relationships are one-way or two-way.


% The \emph{degree} \(d_i\) of a node \(i\) is the number of edges connected to it:
% \begin{align*}
%     d_i & = \big|\big\{j \in V \mid (i, j) \in E\big\}\big|.&
% \end{align*}





% The \emph{degree distribution} \(P(d)\) of a network is a description of the relative frequencies of nodes that
% have different degrees. 
% \vspace{1em}

% In other words, \(P(d)\) is the fraction of nodes that have degree \(d\).
% \vspace{1em}

% The function \(P\) can be a frequency distribution, if we are describing a specific network;
% or a probability distribution, if we are working with random networks.



% For a set of \(n\) nodes and a probability \(p\), the \emph{Erdős-Rényi model} generates a random graph \(G(n, p)\) 
% by going through all possible pairs of nodes and adding an edge between them with probability \(p\).




% The degree distribution of an Erdős-Rényi random graph \(G(n, p)\) is given by the \emph{binomial distribution}:
% \[
%     {\Pr}\Big[ d = k \Big] = {n-1 \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-1-k}.
% \]

% The `typical' node has degree \((n-1)p\).



% A \emph{scale-free network} is a type of network whose degree distribution follows a power law:
% \[
%     P(d) \sim c \cdot d^{-\gamma},
% \]
% where \(c>0\) and \(\gamma\) is a constant typically in the range \(2 < \gamma < 3\).




% The relative frequencies stay constant as the degree grows from \(d\) to \(kd\):
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     \frac{P(kd)}{P(d)} & = \frac{c \cdot k^{-\gamma} d ^{-\gamma}}{c \cdot d^{-\gamma}} &\\ 
%                        & = k^{-\gamma}. &
% \end{flalign*}
% This is true regardless of the degree \(d\) we start with:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     \frac{P(2)}{P(1)} & = \frac{P(20)}{P(10)} = \frac{P(200)}{P(100)} = \dots&
% \end{flalign*}
% Best seen when graphing the degree distribution\dots
% \vspace{1em}

% \dots on a \emph{log-log scale}, for readability:
% the degree distribution of a scale-free network appears as a straight line with slope \(-\gamma\).


% Start with \(m_0\) nodes. New nodes are added, one at a time.
% Each new node connects to an existing node \(i\) with a probability \(p_i\) 
% proportional to \(i\)'s degree:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     p_i & = \frac{d_i}{\sum_{j} d_j}. &
% \end{flalign*}







% The \emph{distance} \(d(i, j)\) between two nodes \(i\) and \(j\) 
% in a network is the length of the shortest path between \(i\) and \(j\).

% The \emph{diameter} of a network \(G\) is the maximum distance between any two nodes:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     \text{diam}(G) & = \max_{i, j \in V} d(i, j). &
% \end{flalign*}


% The maximum distance (i.e., diameter) is 
% \(2\) in \(G_1\). 
% \vspace{1em}

% And \(4\) in \(G_2\).


% The \emph{neighborhood} \(N(i)\) of a node \(i\) is the set of nodes that are directly connected to \(i\):
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     N(i) & = \big\{j \in V \mid (i, j) \in E\big\}. &
% \end{flalign*}


% The \emph{degree} \(d_i\) of a node \(i\) is the size of \(i\)'s neighborhood:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     d_i & = \big|N(i) \big|, &
% \end{flalign*}
% i.e., the number of nodes directly connected to \(i\).


% Consider the \emph{star graph} \(G_1\).
% \vspace{1em}

% And the \emph{(binary) tree} \(G_2\).
% \vspace{1em}

% The distance between \(i\) and \(j\) is \(2\) in \(G_1\) and \(4\) in \(G_2\).


% The \emph{average shortest path length} \(\mathit{L}(G)\) of a network \(G\) is the average distance between all pairs of nodes:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     \mathit{L}(G) & = \frac{1}{|V|(|V|-1)} \sum_{i, j \in V} d(i, j). &
% \end{flalign*}


% The \emph{clustering coefficient} \(\mathit{Cl}(i)\) of a node \(i\) is the fraction of pairs of its neighbors 
% connected to each other:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \quad
%     \mathit{Cl}(i) & = \frac{\text{number of edges between neighbors of } i}{\text{number of pairs of neighbors of } i} 
%                      = \frac{\bigg|\Big\{\{j, k\} \subseteq N(i) \mid (j, k) \in E\Big\}\bigg|}{\bigg|\Big\{\{j, k\} \subseteq N(i)\Big\}\bigg|} & \\
%                    & = \frac{\bigg|\Big\{\{j, k\} \subseteq N(i) \mid (j, k) \in E\Big\}\bigg|}{\binom{d_i}{2}}  &\\
%                      & = 2 \cdot \frac{\bigg|\Big\{\{j, k\} \subseteq N(i) \mid (j, k) \in E\Big\}\bigg|}{d_i(d_i - 1)}. &
% \end{flalign*}


% The \emph{clustering coefficient} \(\mathit{Cl}(G)\) of network \(G\) is the average clustering coefficient of its nodes:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     \mathit{Cl}(G) & = \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{i \in V} \mathit{Cl}(i). &
% \end{flalign*}


% A \emph{small-world network} is a type of network characterized by a \emph{high clustering coefficient} and 
% \emph{short average path length}:
%     \[
%         \mathit{L}(G) \sim \log(|V|),
%     \]
% i.e., the average distance between any two nodes is proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes.


% Start with a graph where each node is connected to exactly \(k\) other nodes. 
% Then, at every time step, randomly rewire each edge with probability \(p\) to an unattached node.



% The \emph{degree centrality}\(^*\) \(C_d(i)\) of node \(i\) is the number of nodes connected to \(i\):
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     C_d(i) & = d_i. &
% \end{flalign*}

% To make it easier to compare centralities across different networks, 
% we can normalize it relative to the total number \(n\) of nodes:
% \begin{flalign*}
%     \qquad
%     C_d(i) & = \frac{d_i}{n - 1}. &
% \end{flalign*}

% \(^*\)Note that this definition applies to undirected networks.




Take \(\sigma_{j, k}\) to be \emph{the number of shortest paths between \(j\) and \(k\)}, 
and \(\sigma_{j, k}(i)\) to be the number of shortest paths between \(j\) and \(k\) 
\emph{that pass through \(i\)}.
\vspace{1em}

The \emph{betweeness centrality} of node \(i\) is defined as: 
\begin{flalign*}
    \qquad
    C_{\mathit{bet}}(i) & = \frac{1}{\nicefrac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}} \cdot 
        \sum_{j \neq k, j \neq i, k \neq i } \frac{\sigma_{j, k}(i)}{\sigma_{j, k}}, &
\end{flalign*}
i.e., the average fraction of shortest paths that pass through \(i\)
