\begin{document}\raggedright
    % There is a player, \emph{Nature}, that determines 
    % Player~\(1\)'s type (High or Low)
    % with some probability.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\) chooses whether to send a signal.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Sending the signal incurs cost \(c_H\) if 
    % Player \(1\) is of High type, and \(c_L\) if Low type.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(2\) only observes the signal,
    % but does not know Player \(1\)'s type (the dashed line).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(2\) chooses to accept or reject Player \(1\).

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(1\) gets a benefit \(b > 0\) if they are accepted, 
    % and nothing if they are rejected. And they also pay the cost of sending the signal.

    % \vspace{0.2cm}
    % Player \(2\) gets \(a > 0\) if they accept a high type, 
    % \(-a\) if they accept a low type,\(^*\)
    % and nothing if they reject.


    Keeping Player \(1\)'s strategy fixed, Player \(2\) does not want to deviate 
    just in case:
    \[
        a > 0,
    \]
    which we've assumed to be the case.

    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Keeping Player \(2\)'s strategy fixed, Player \(1\) does not want to deviate
    just in case:
    \[
        b - c_H \geq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad b - c_L \leq 0,
    \]
    which is equivalent to:
    \[
        c_H \leq b \leq c_L.
    \]
